# CS231A-Project

This project uses Google's MediaPipe Pose model to offer guidance on weightlifting, specifically whether a user is acheiving full range of motion.
Currently, the lift that is implemented is the Bent-Over Row.

To run the code, make sure you have MediaPipe installed. This can be done with

```pip install mediapipe```

Then, in your terminal, run

```python3 compare.py```
